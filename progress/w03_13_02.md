### How I am doing

<br/>
<u>Self assessment of how I felt this week:</u>

- My mood this week was exciting and overwhelmed at the same time because I really didn't know what to expect.
  
- Compared to last week, I feel more encouraged  because there's alot progress and learnings along the way!

- I find the project to be exciting it challenges me , needs an apt person to work on it, i enjoy working on it

- My level of stress is manageable
